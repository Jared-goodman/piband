## PiHat

This is the website for the PiHat. It is my project that I am entering in the Seattle MiniMakerFaire. The hat is a wearable device equiped with a raspberry pi that can answer questions, define words, translate, etc. Lots of the software is already finished, however the hardware will be done soon. The project is in a bulky magician's hat, however if accepted into the Maker Faire I am willing to increase my bujdget to make it smaller and have it as a neclace. This is a list of all the things it can do so far:

1. chatbot (uses a slightly customized version of API.AI's smalltalk)

2. current weather conditions (e.g. "what's the weather like here?")

3. date/time/timers (e.g. "Set a timer for 4 minutes.", "what's the date")

4. read xkcd transcripts (e.g. "Read me xkcd number 486", "Read me the current XKCD

5. define words (thesaurus coming soon! Like today soon!) (e.g "define hat")

6. translations fron English into most languages supported by Espeak (Powered by [Yandex Translate](http://translate.yandex.com)). (e.g. translate "hello" to Esperanto)

7. Repeaat what you say (e.g. "say hello")

8. Summon Cthulu (it says "ok, summoning Cthulu now and then screams in a suddenly deep voice, PN'NGLU MGL'NAFH CTHULU R'LYEH WGAH'NAGL FHTAGN).

More features coming soon! And pictures and videos!
